- **Advantages**: Robust, handles non-linear patterns, less overfitting
- **Configuration**: 100 trees, max depth 10, optimized for expense prediction

### Feature Set
1. **Month** (1-12): Seasonal spending patterns
2. **Day of Month** (1-31): Monthly spending cycles
3. **Day of Week** (0-6): Weekly spending patterns
4. **Weekend Flag** (0/1): Weekend vs weekday spending
5. **Days Since Start**: Long-term trend analysis
6. **Category Encoding**: Spending category patterns
7. **Amount (Log)**: Spending amount distribution

### Training Requirements
- **Minimum Data**: 10+ expenses
- **Data Quality**: Consistent category names and amounts
- **Time Range**: At least 2-3 months of data for meaningful patterns

## 📈 Prediction Accuracy

### Metrics
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average prediction error in rupees
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: Standard deviation of errors
- **R² Score**: Model fit quality (0-1, higher is better)

### Confidence Levels
- **High (80%+)**: Predictions based on strong historical patterns
- **Medium (60-80%)**: Predictions with moderate confidence
- **Low (<60%)**: Predictions with limited historical data
