## 1. Overview

The Expense Tracker is a full-stack application consisting of:

-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) - Serves the API endpoints and interacts with the database.
-   **Frontend**: React (JavaScript) - A single-page application that consumes the backend API.
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL - Stores all application data.

For local development, we use Docker Compose to manage all three components. For production, you might consider various cloud hosting options.

## 2. Prerequisites

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (for local deployment and containerization)
-   [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) (for backend development/local testing)
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (for frontend development/local testing)
-   Familiarity with environment variables and basic shell commands.

## 3. PostgreSQL Database Deployment

### Local Development (Docker Compose)

The easiest way to run PostgreSQL locally is using the provided `docker-compose.yml` file in the `expense-tracker-backend/` directory.

```bash
cd expense-tracker-backend
docker-compose up -d postgres
```

This will start a PostgreSQL container named `expense_tracker_db` on port `5432`. The database name, user, and password are defined in `docker-compose.yml` and can be overridden via environment variables or directly in the file.

After starting the database, you'll need to run migrations to create the necessary tables:

```bash
make init-db
```

### Production Considerations

For production, it's highly recommended to use a managed PostgreSQL service from a cloud provider (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL). This offloads database management, backups, and scaling.

-   **Connection String**: Ensure your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is correctly configured to point to your managed database.
-   **Security**: Implement strong passwords, network isolation, and encryption.
-   **Backups**: Configure automated backups.
-   **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and alerting for database performance and health.

## 4. FastAPI Backend Deployment

### Local Development (Python/Uvicorn)

For local development, you can run the FastAPI application directly with Uvicorn:

```bash
cd expense-tracker-backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Production Deployment (Gunicorn + Uvicorn Workers)

For production, Uvicorn should be run with a production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn to handle multiple worker processes and better concurrency.

1.  **Install Gunicorn**: Add `gunicorn` to your `requirements.txt` and install it.

    ```bash
    pip install gunicorn
    ```

2.  **Run with Gunicorn**: Use a command similar to this (adjust `--workers` based on your server's CPU cores, typically `2 * CPU_CORES + 1`):

    ```bash
    gunicorn main:app --workers 4 --worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
    ```

### Containerization (Docker)

Creating a `Dockerfile` for your backend allows for consistent deployment across different environments.

**Example `Dockerfile` for Backend (in `expense-tracker-backend/`):**

```dockerfile
# Use a lightweight Python image
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements file and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port FastAPI runs on
EXPOSE 8000

# Command to run the application with Gunicorn
CMD ["gunicorn", "main:app", "--workers", "4", "--worker-class", "uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
```

To build and run this Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t expense-tracker-backend .
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env expense-tracker-backend
```

### Environment Variables

Ensure all necessary environment variables (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY`, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`) are set in your production environment. Use a `.env` file for local development and your deployment platform's secrets management for production.

## 5. React Frontend Deployment

### Local Development (Vite)

For local development, you can run the React application with Vite's development server:

```bash
cd expense-tracker-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Production Build

To prepare your React application for production, you need to build it. This generates optimized static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

```bash
cd expense-tracker-frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder containing the static assets.

### Serving Static Files (Nginx/Cloud Storage)

In production, these static files are typically served by a web server (like Nginx) or a cloud storage service (like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage) with a CDN.

**Example Nginx configuration (e.g., `/etc/nginx/sites-available/expense-tracker`):**

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain.com www.your_domain.com;

    root /var/www/expense-tracker-frontend/dist; # Path to your frontend build directory
    index index.html index.htm;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html; # For React routing
    }

    # Proxy API requests to the backend
    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000; # Or your backend service URL
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

### Containerization (Docker)

You can also containerize your frontend application. This `Dockerfile` often uses a multi-stage build to first build the React app and then serve it with a lightweight Nginx server.

**Example `Dockerfile` for Frontend (in `expense-tracker-frontend/`):**

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build the React application
FROM node:18-alpine as builder

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve the application with Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Remove default Nginx config and add custom one (see example above)
# COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

To build and run this Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t expense-tracker-frontend .
docker run -p 80:80 expense-tracker-frontend
```

## 6. Connecting Components

When deploying, especially with Docker, it's crucial for your components to find each other.

-   **Backend to Database**: The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your backend needs to point to your PostgreSQL instance. If using Docker Compose, service names can be used (e.g., `postgresql://user:password@postgres:5432/dbname`). For cloud, use the provided connection string.

-   **Frontend to Backend**: The frontend needs to know the URL of your backend API. This is usually configured in the frontend's environment variables (e.g., `VITE_API_URL` for Vite). If you're using Nginx to proxy API requests, the frontend can make requests to `/api/` which Nginx will then forward to the backend.

-   **CORS**: Ensure your FastAPI backend's `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` are correctly configured to include the domain(s) where your frontend is hosted.

## 7. Production Best Practices

-   **Environment Variables**: Never hardcode sensitive information. Use environment variables and a secrets management system provided by your cloud provider.
-   **HTTPS**: Always deploy with HTTPS to encrypt traffic.
-   **Monitoring & Logging**: Implement robust monitoring and logging for both frontend and backend applications.
-   **CI/CD**: Set up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
-   **Scaling**: Design your application to scale horizontally (running multiple instances of your backend/frontend) to handle increased load.
-   **Security**: Regularly update dependencies, perform security audits, and follow best practices for API security.
-   **Backup Strategy**: Implement a comprehensive backup strategy for your database.

This guide provides a solid foundation for deploying your Expense Tracker application. The specific tools and services might vary based on your chosen cloud provider (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Heroku, Vercel, Netlify, etc.).
